//This code is meant to test a multi microswitch setup.
//It has a microswitch connected to pins 9 and 10 on the
//arduino as inputs. The microswitch has 3 connections:
//NC(normally closed), NO(normally open), and COM(sommon)
//First connect 5V to the common connection,
//Then connect NO to a 560ohm resistor that goes to ground
//Also connect one of the arduino pins to NO
//It will read 0 when the switch is not pressed and 1 when it is
//
