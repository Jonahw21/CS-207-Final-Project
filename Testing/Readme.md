This folder contains all code that was used during the design and testing of this project. If you would like to try building this feel
free to use the code here to test out your own project as you go. Otherwise it just serves as a reference for what I've done so far

The ode_to_joy file contains a program that play a tune to test out the tones and piezo speaker.

The Arcade_button_test program is meant to use the serial output to verify that a button is properly wired and functioning.

The Tone_testing program is meant to test a range of values for the tone function to produce specific notes.
