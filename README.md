# CS-207-Final-Project
Everything pertaining to my final project, a button controlled interactive instrument.

Currently I am working on testing and setting up the basics. Right now that involves setting up the microswitches and arcade buttons
to work with my arduino Uno. The test sketch "button test" details how to connect two microswitches to the arduino and verify that they
work. This basic idea will be replicated to attach numerous buttons to the arduino. Next will be setting each button input to correspond to a different audio output.
